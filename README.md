Reproducing 'Free Lunch for Few-shot Learning: Distribution Calibration' 

The algorithm presented in the paper is implemented in evaluate_DC. This is the file we have rewritten from scratch and to which we added the code that produces the implementations. 

FSLTask.py contains the creation of the datasets in a convenient way for the algorithm. We left this file as it was in the initial codebase created by the authors since it is not related to the work presented in the paper.
